# React Cloudscape Example Application Requirements

## Overview
Create a React example application using AWS Cloudscape Design System that demonstrates the full capabilities of the CDK Serverless Agentic API construct. The application should provide a complete user experience with authentication and CRUD operations.

## Functional Requirements

### Authentication & User Management
- **User Registration**: Users can create new Cognito accounts with email/password
- **Email Confirmation**: Users must confirm their email with a confirmation code during signup
- **User Login**: Users can authenticate using Cognito credentials
- **Password Management**: Users can change their password when logged in
- **Session Management**: Automatic token refresh and logout on expiration
- **Protected Routes**: Authenticated routes that redirect to login when not authenticated

### CRUD Operations
- **Create Items**: Authenticated users can create new items in DynamoDB
- **Read Items**: Authenticated users can view a list of their items
- **Update Items**: Authenticated users can edit existing items
- **Delete Items**: Authenticated users can remove items
- **Item Ownership**: Users can only access their own items (user-scoped data)

### User Interface Requirements
- **Design System**: Use AWS Cloudscape Design System components
- **Responsive Design**: Application works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Loading States**: Show loading indicators during API calls
- **Error Handling**: Display user-friendly error messages
- **Form Validation**: Client-side validation for all forms
- **Navigation**: Clear navigation between different sections

### State Management
- **Redux Integration**: Use Redux Toolkit for application state management
- **Authentication State**: Manage user authentication status globally
- **Items State**: Manage CRUD operations state (loading, data, errors)
- **UI State**: Manage UI-specific state (modals, notifications)

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend Technology Stack
- **React**: Latest stable version (18+)
- **TypeScript**: Full TypeScript implementation
- **Redux Toolkit**: For state management
- **AWS Cloudscape**: Design system components
- **React Router**: For client-side routing
- **AWS Amplify**: For Cognito integration
- **Axios**: For API calls

### Backend Integration
- **CDK Construct**: Use the CDKServerlessAgenticAPI construct
- **Lambda Functions**: CRUD operations for items management
- **DynamoDB**: Single table design with user-scoped data
- **Cognito Authentication**: JWT token-based authentication
- **API Gateway**: RESTful API endpoints

### Infrastructure Requirements
- **DynamoDB Table**: Items table with userId as partition key
- **Lambda Functions**: 
  - GET /items (list user's items)
  - POST /items (create new item)
  - PUT /items/{id} (update item)
  - DELETE /items/{id} (delete item)
- **Cognito User Pool**: User authentication
- **API Gateway**: Protected endpoints requiring authentication

## Data Model

### User (Cognito)
- Email (username)
- Password
- User attributes (name, etc.)

### Item (DynamoDB)
```typescript
interface Item {
  id: string;           // Sort key
  userId: string;       // Partition key
  title: string;
  description: string;
  category: string;
  status: 'active' | 'inactive';
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
}
```

## User Experience Flow

### Authentication Flow
1. User visits application
2. If not authenticated, redirect to login page
3. User can login or register
4. After successful authentication, redirect to dashboard
5. User can access protected features

### CRUD Operations Flow
1. User navigates to items dashboard
2. View list of existing items
3. Can create new items via form
4. Can edit existing items inline or via modal
5. Can delete items with confirmation
6. All operations show loading states and error handling

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Initial page load under 3 seconds
- API responses under 1 second
- Smooth UI interactions

### Security
- All API endpoints require authentication
- Users can only access their own data
- Secure token storage and management
- Input validation and sanitization

### Usability
- Intuitive navigation and user interface
- Clear error messages and feedback
- Consistent design patterns
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)

### Maintainability
- Clean, well-documented code
- Modular component structure
- Proper error boundaries
- Comprehensive TypeScript types

## Success Criteria
- Users can successfully register and login
- Users can perform all CRUD operations on items
- Application is responsive and accessible
- Code is well-structured and maintainable
- Integration with CDK construct is seamless
- Redux state management is properly implemented
